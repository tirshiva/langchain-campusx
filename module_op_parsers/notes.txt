Output Parsers in langchain helps convert raw LLM responses into structured formats like JSON, CSV, Pydantic models, and more. They ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in applications.

Types of Output Parsers:
1. String Output Parsers
2. JSON Output Parsers
3. Structured Output Parsers
4. Pydantic Output Parsers


- StrOutputParser
The StrOutputParser is the simplest output parser in langchain. It is used to parse the output of a Language Model (LLM) and return it as a plain string.

The biggest flaw of JSON Output Parser is that it does not enforce schema.

3. Structured Output Parser
- StrOutputParser is an output parser in langchain that helps extract structured JSON data from LLM responses based on predefined field schemas.

It works by defining a list of fields (Response Schema) that the model should return, ensuring the output follows a structured format.

Pydantic Output Parser

Pydantic Output Parser is a structured output parser in langchain that uses Pydantic models to enforce schema validation when processing LLM responses.

Why use Pydantic Output Parser?
- Strict Schema Enforcement : Ensure that LLM responses follow a well defined structure
- Type Safety : Automatically converts LLM output into python objects
- Easy validation : Uses Pydantic's built in validation to catch incorrect or missing data
- Seamless Integration : works well with other langchain components
