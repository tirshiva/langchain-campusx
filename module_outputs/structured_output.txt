In Langchain, structured output refers to the practice of having language models return responses in a well defined data format (for example JSON), rather than free-form text. This makes the model output easier to parse and work with programmatically.

Why do we need structured output

1. Data Extraction
2. API building
3. Agents

Ways to get structured output

There are two types of model in Langchain:
1. Can generate structured output - (with_structure_output())
2. Cannot generate structured output - Output_parsers

with_structure_output -> data format
model.invoke()

- TypedDict
- Pydantic
- json_schema

TypedDict - TypedDict is a way to define a dictionary in python where you specify what keys and values should exists. It helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure.

why use TypedDict?
- It tells python what keys are required and what type of values they should have.
- It does not validate data at runtime (It just helps type hints for better coding).

When you use with_structure_output internally It adds in prompt that - You are an AI assistant that extracts structured insights from text. Given a product review, extract: - Summary: A brief overview of the main points. - Sentiment: Overall tone of the review (positive, neutral, negative). Return the response in JSON format.
